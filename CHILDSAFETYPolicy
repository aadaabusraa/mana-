**Last updated:** March 2026  
**App name:** MANA

## Our Commitment

MANA is a humanitarian giving platform that connects donors with verified NGOs and individuals in need. We are unconditionally committed to the safety and protection of children. We have zero tolerance for any content, behaviour, or activity that sexually exploits or abuses minors in any form.

---

## Prohibited Content and Behaviour

The following are strictly prohibited on MANA and will result in immediate account termination and, where required by law, reporting to the relevant authorities:

- Any content that sexually exploits, abuses, or endangers minors (anyone under the age of 18)
- Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) of any kind — including images, video, text, or illustrations
- Grooming behaviour, solicitation, or any attempt to establish inappropriate contact with a minor
- Using the platform to traffic, exploit, or facilitate harm to children
- Fundraising campaigns that misrepresent, exploit, or put children at risk
- Sharing personal information about minors without verifiable parental or guardian consent

---

## How We Enforce These Standards

**Verification**  
All NGOs listed on MANA undergo an independent verification process before appearing on the platform. Campaigns involving children require additional documentation confirming the legitimacy and safeguarding practices of the organising body.

**Moderation**  
Our trust and safety team reviews flagged content promptly. Any content suspected of violating our child safety standards is removed immediately pending investigation.

**Reporting to Authorities**  
MANA is legally obligated to — and will always — report confirmed or suspected CSAM and child exploitation to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) via CyberTipline, and to local law enforcement as required by jurisdiction.

## How to Report a Violation

If you encounter any content or behaviour on MANA that you believe violates these standards, please report it immediately:

- **In-app:** Tap the three-dot menu on any profile or campaign → "Report"
- **Email:** safety@mana.app
- **Emergency:** If a child is in immediate danger, contact your local emergency services (e.g. 911, 999, 112) without delay

We take all reports seriously. Reports are reviewed within 24 hours and escalated immediately if a child is at risk.
